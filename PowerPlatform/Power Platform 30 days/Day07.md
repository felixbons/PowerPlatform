# Day 7 – Best Practices for Working with the Power Platform Interface

---

## 📝 Overview

The Power Platform interface is designed to help makers build apps, flows, and bots efficiently. However, mastering the layout, tools, and settings can save you time and help you avoid common mistakes.

In this session, you’ll explore **interface best practices** for Power Apps and Power Automate — covering workspace organization, naming conventions, UI settings, and productivity tips to enhance your development experience.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide

### ✅ Step 1: Use Clear and Consistent Naming

- Always name your controls, variables, screens, and flows meaningfully.
  - ✅ Example: `btn_Submit`, `gal_Employees`, `txt_EmailInput`
  - ❌ Avoid: `Label1`, `TextInput3`
- Use prefixes like `btn_`, `txt_`, `lbl_`, `gal_`, `var_` to identify the control or data type quickly.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Organize Screens and Components

- Group related screens logically (e.g., `Home`, `Details`, `Admin`)
- Rename screens in Power Apps from `Screen1` → `scr_Home` or `scr_EmployeeDetails`
- Use **Components** for repeated UI sections (headers, footers, menus)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use the Tree View for Quick Navigation

- Open the **Tree View** (left panel) to easily jump between screens and controls
- Reorder controls by dragging them in the tree to manage layering
- Rename each element directly from the Tree View

---

### ✅ Step 4: Leverage the Properties Panel

- Use the **right-side panel** to:
  - Change control properties (color, text, alignment)
  - Bind items to data
  - Update default values or formats

---

### ✅ Step 5: Use the Formula Bar Efficiently

- Collapse the properties panel when working with complex formulas
- Use indentation and comments (`//`) to make formulas readable
- Break long formulas into **variables** to simplify and reuse logic

---

### ✅ Step 6: Save and Version Regularly

- Save your app frequently with version comments
- Use **File > Save as** to create backups of key milestones
- In Power Automate, check **flow versions** and revert if needed

---

### ✅ Step 7: Turn On Useful Experimental Features

- In Power Apps Studio, go to **Settings > Upcoming Features**
- Enable:
  - Modern controls
  - Improved formula bar
  - Enhanced component libraries (if applicable)

---

## 🔎 What You Should Try Today
