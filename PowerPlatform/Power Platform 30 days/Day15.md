# Day 15 ‚Äì Power Automate: Creating Automated, Instant, and Scheduled Flows

---

## üìù Overview

Power Automate supports three types of flows:
- **Automated flows**: Triggered by events like receiving an email or adding a SharePoint item.
- **Instant flows**: Triggered manually via a button in Power Apps or from the Power Automate app.
- **Scheduled flows**: Run at specific times or intervals (e.g., every day at 8 AM).

In this session, you'll learn how to create each type of flow and understand their common use cases.
