# Day 27 – Solutions, Environments, Export/Import Practices

---

## 📝 Overview

Solutions in Power Platform are containers for apps, flows, tables, and components that help manage development, testing, and deployment across environments. Understanding how to package, export, and import solutions is key for lifecycle management and governance.

Today, you'll learn how to create a solution, add components, manage environments, and export/import your solutions between development and production.
