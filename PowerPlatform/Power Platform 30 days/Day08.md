# Day 8 ‚Äì Controls: Forms, Galleries, Buttons, Dropdowns

---

## üìù Overview

Controls are the interactive building blocks of Power Apps. They let users view data, input information, perform actions, and navigate between screens. The most commonly used controls include:

- **Galleries**: Display a list of records visually.
- **Forms**: Show or edit a single record.
- **Buttons**: Trigger logic such as saving data or navigating screens.
- **Dropdowns**: Allow users to choose from a list of values.

In this session, you'll learn how to add and configure these controls, connect them to your data sources, and create basic app functionality.
