# Day 4 – Build Your First Canvas App from a Template

---

## 📝 Overview

Canvas apps allow you to design powerful, responsive apps by dragging and dropping controls onto a blank canvas — similar to PowerPoint. To speed up the learning process, Microsoft provides **ready-to-use templates** that you can customize.

In this session, you’ll create your first Canvas app using a template. This helps you understand the basic layout, structure, and how Power Apps interacts with data behind the scenes.
