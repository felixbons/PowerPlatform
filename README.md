# PowerPlatform
I created this repository in Github to write about all knowledge that I have with PowerPlatform starting from easy topics checking the PowerApps Editor, basic functionalities, modern controls, advance controls, components and more, also all the new tendencies with AI and others.

In addition, my idea is share my knowledge and improve it, in the process that writing, taking screenshots and practice again.

Finally, I'm planning to have a record of all my activities, special tricks, recommendations to share with any people that need it and also use it as evidence of my work.
